"""
Multi-GPU matvec for the matrix-free FEA (GPU edition only).

Mirrors ``parallel_cpu.CPUMatVecPool`` exactly: the element list is split
into contiguous chunks, one per visible CUDA device, and each device
computes a partial output vector (gather -> 24x24 matmul -> scale by density
-> scatter-add) which is then summed. Same non-approximation argument as the
CPU version: because the scatter-add only writes by index, summing the
per-device partials reproduces exactly what one full-precision bincount over
all elements would give (up to floating-point summation-order round-off,
identical in spirit to running the CPU pool with >1 worker).

Unlike the CPU pool this does NOT use separate OS processes -- Cu-Py already
lets one Python process drive multiple CUDA devices via ``cp.cuda.Device(i)``
context managers, so each "worker" here is just a per-device array cache in
this process. Per apply() call: broadcast p to every device (host-staged),
compute the local partial on each device, copy each partial back to host and
sum there. Peer-to-peer device-to-device transfers are deliberately not
used: enabling P2P requires ``cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess``, which can fail
silently on some topologies (e.g. GPUs on different PCIe root complexes, or
mixed GPU models) -- host-staging is slower but always works.

This module has not been exercised on real multi-GPU hardware. It only
activates when compute_plan.choose() picks "multi_gpu" (ndof >=
compute_plan.MULTI_GPU_DOF and >1 usable CUDA device). Run with the
"Verbose solver log" option enabled and check the printed device count /
timings the first time you use it on your machine.
